          What's the <span class="txt-highlight">Workshop</span> about?
        </h2>
        <p class="bold txt-highlight">
          You’re an experienced English teacher working with adults. That’s why
          you’re here. <br> And that’s why this workshop is for you.
        </p>
        <p class="txt-highlight">
          We would like to introduce you to the new teaching method that we have been
          developing within our interdisciplinary transnational team of
          educators, teachers, methodologists and all the professionals who care about
          the high quality of learning outcomes. The IC-English method is a set
          of tools that consists of training materials for adult learners, a
          practical e-handbook and e-learning lessons that are addressed to you to
          help you fully use all the capabilities of what we’ve created.
        </p>
        <p class="txt-highlight">
          During the workshop we will ask you to share with us feedback on the
          method and all the tools associated with it. Your voice is what improves
          our materials and makes them better adjusted to the real needs of learners
          and teachers/trainers.
